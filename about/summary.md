# Summary

In this discussion we present the first ever smart DAO protocol; this idea is similar to Ethereum in the sense that both protocols work with decentralized immutable storage. However, instead launching contracts from chains, we work with Diamonds by exploiting the multi-facet proxy that was first presented in EIP-2535 \[5]. To make the analogy, if Ethereum is the UNIX platform, then DAOSYS is the enterprise development system, which is utilized via low code or no code deployments.

DAOSYS allows for the self-sovereign capital coordination within decentralized organizations, which is the main problem that this project addresses. It does this via its new ASE technology which is made possible through an extension of the multi-facet proxy (ie, Diamonds) outlined in EIP- 2535. We call this extension the Hyper-diamond standard.

DAOSYS is planning to launch on Rollux’s mainnet in the early part of 2023, which is Syscoin’s L2. During this event, we are also planning to launch the first of a new class of DAOs called Masternode Yield Farming. In this discussion, we have presented five-year ROI estimates using our DeFi python simulator that can also be used by community members who may be interested in testing out various business cases for DAO DeFi strategies.
