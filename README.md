# ðŸ–Œ Purpose

Despite popular perception, treasuries of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) tend to be centrally controlled and do not reflect the true ethos of cryptocurrency (i.e., not your keys, not your coins). DAOSYS solves this problem with its new Autonomous Service Engine (ASE) technology by deploying a reference platform for self-sovereign capital coordination. Through the ASE, the DAOSYS token will serve as a protocol layer creating a fully backed non-speculative asset allowing for quick seamless deployment of child DAOs in a secure manner. This is made possible by innovating on the multi-faceted proxy standard defined in EIP-2535. The ASE will serve as the cornerstone of all SYS Labs decentralized finance (DeFi) products, as supported by the Syscoin Platform..
